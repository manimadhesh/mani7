          The explosion of T20 cricket on the Indian subcontinent paved the way
          for the formation of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008. In the
          league‚Äôs inaugural season, Dhoni signed with the Chennai Super Kings
          for $1.5 million, which at the time was the largest contract in the
          IPL. He subsequently led the team to two consecutive titles (2010,
          2011). The Super Kings franchise earned a two-season suspension from
          the IRL in 2016 for its role in a match-fixing scandal, and Dhoni then
          joined the Rising Pune Supergiant. In 2018 he returned to the Chennai
          Super Kings, and the team won the IPL championship that year and in
          2021. Dhoni‚Äôs life was the subject of the hit Bollywood film M.S.
          Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016).
